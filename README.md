# Huffman Coding in C

Huffman Coding is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns variable-length binary codes to characters based on their frequency. This project implements Huffman coding in C, enabling efficient text file compression and decompression. It is ideal for reducing file size while preserving all original data.
